                What Is {{ config.SITE_NAME }}?
            </h3>
            <p>
                {{ config.SITE_NAME }} is a useful reminder tool for anyone who uses
                a <a href="http://www.breezecard.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Breeze&reg; Card Website">Breeze&reg; Card</a>
                to ride <a href="http://www.itsmarta.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="MARTA&reg; Website">MARTA&reg;</a>
                around Atlanta on their daily commute, to and from sporting events, or 
                for any other reason. Whether it's a note to remind you to refill your card or
                an upcoming expiration date, reminders are customizable to your needs and can
                be sent to your email or mobile phone.

                Why We Made This
            </h3>
            <p>
                Simple. It's about convenience and creating a better experience. Using public transit can
                save you time, money and headaches from sitting in traffic. For some of us, the cost to commute
                to and from Atlanta was between $17 and $20 per day. Per day!
                In fact, this site was created almost entirely while taking public transit.
                But there was something missing: reminders.
